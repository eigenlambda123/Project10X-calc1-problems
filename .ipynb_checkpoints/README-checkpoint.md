# Calculus Problem Sets â€“ Based on Paul's Online Math Notes

This repository contains my organized solutions and study notes for the Calculus I course from [Paul's Online Math Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/CalcI.aspx). It serves as a personal study log and problem set archive as I work through key concepts and example problems to deepen my calculus intuition and technical fluency.

## Resource Used

All problems are taken from:
**Paul Dawkinsâ€™ Calculus I** â€“ Lamar University

## Structure & Organization

Each folder corresponds to a major topic in Calculus I. Within each folder you'll find:

- **Problem Sets** with my handwritten or typed solutions
- **Brief Notes** summarizing key concepts when needed
- **Diagrams** or visualizations (if applicable)
- **Subdirectories** for each section's problems (e.g., `Domain & Range`, `Limits`, `Derivatives`)

## How I'm Solving

Most problems are:
- Solved **by hand** on paper
- then typed using Markdown for  future reference
- Accompanied by concise notes to clarify **why** a solution works

The goal is **not speed**, but **mastery**â€”this is part of my long-term technical foundation building under my [Project10X Calculus](#) effort.

## Work In Progress

This repository will grow gradually as I move through the course. Some sections are under development or may only contain partial solutions.

---

## Covered Topics (in progress)

- [x] Functions â€“ domain, range, piecewise
- [ ] Limits â€“ numerical and analytical
- [ ] Continuity and One-Sided Limits
- [ ] Derivative definitions and rules
- [ ] Applications of derivatives (increasing/decreasing, optimization)
- [ ] Integrals

## Tools Used

- Markdown + Git for clean version control
- LaTeX (when needed) for math notation
- Diagrams drawn manually or with Desmos / graphing tools
